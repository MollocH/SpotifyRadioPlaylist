# SpotifyRadioPlaylist
A Simple tool that allows you to listen to Spotify radio and save every track into a playlist

Big thanks to JohnnyCrazy over @ https://github.com/JohnnyCrazy/.
Used his https://github.com/JohnnyCrazy/SpotifyAPI-NET to create my little application

Instructions:
- Spotify Premium. This is a spotify restriction for using their API
- Dotnet 4.5.2 is required
- Install the Program
- Create a playlist in spotify
- Make sure spotify and spotifyWebHelper are running before running RadioPlaylist
- Run RadioPlaylist
- Choose a playlist and press start
- every song you play from now on will be added to the selected playlist
- press stop to stop the session

Please note: you can create a playlist in no time just by skipping to the next song every second (could be a feature in a future release to let the program create a playlist of x songs)

This is, for now, just a prove of concept. It has not many functionality, but it is a feature I was missing for quite a long time.
Future releases will have more feature and an improved interface.
